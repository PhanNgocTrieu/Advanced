/*
    Given a directory, write a program that will find all files with the same name in
    the directory and its sub directories. Show their name, which folder they are in
    and what day they were created. Expand the program to remove all duplicate
    copies based on user input. That is, ask user if each one of the file is to be kept or
    deleted. Based on user input, perform the appropriate action.
